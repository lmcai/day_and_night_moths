It also occurs in more disturbed agricultural areas at low elevations east of the Cascades. In the Columbia Basin it is found in dry sandy areas as well as near wet meadows. BugGuide: Damp shrubby or weedy areas bordering rivers, streams, marshes where food plants grow. Wikipedia: This species inhabits moist open forest and meadow areas, mixed hardwood forests at low elevations, open meadows or prairies and in agricultural areas at low elevations.[4] It is common on low-growing plants, on high-roads, railway embankments and waste fields.
